I'm building a very simple blog that explains to people how to get a ServiceNow Job.

**The plan in no specific order:**

* Build a blog in Gatsby or Next.JS
* Create about three blog posts:

  1.  One explaining what ServiceNow is
  2. One explaining the steps to get your first job
  3. The third one explaining learning Javascript
* Maybe invite people to a Discord??
* Get users to sign up to an email newsletter to get the cheatsheet 



**How it makes money**

* Sell newsletter spots
* Allow recruiters to post their jobs on the blog
